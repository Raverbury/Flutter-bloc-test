This is a test, don't you agree Jean Pierre Polnareff?

Basic app built with BLoC pattern, similar to View <==info==> Controller.
Everything happens in a bloc behind the scene, not in the UI.

# Run

```
flutter run -d chrome
```

Or honestly, any device you want, it should work, probably.

# Documentation

No, too lazy.
But you can check [this guide](https://blog.logrocket.com/state-management-flutter-bloc-pattern/) out. Helped a bunch.
